Hide gather.town's sidebar and widgets for a better video recording experience

## Usage

Firstly, grab a copy of the [latest source code release](https://github.com/serverwentdown/gather-fullscreen/releases). Extract it to a path, and load the extension into Firefox or Chrome.

**Firefox**: Visit `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` and click on "Load Temporary Add-on". Pick the extracted `manifest.json` file.

**Chrome**: Visit `chrome://extensions`, enable "Developer mode" and click on "Load unpacked". Pick the extracted folder.

Now, when you have joined the Gathering, right click on the sidebar and select "Make Gather fullscreen". The sidebar will dissapear. To get the sidebar back, reload the page.
